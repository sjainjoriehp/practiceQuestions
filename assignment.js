Frontend Developer Assignment: WYSIWYG Web Page Builder

Overview
Create a simple web-based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) web page builder inspired by WordPress and Wix. The builder should allow users to create a basic web page layout by dragging and dropping components, editing text, and previewing the final layout.

Functional Requirements
1. User Interface:
   - A canvas area where users can design their web page.
   - A toolbar with draggable components (e.g., text, image, button).
   - Basic styling options for the components (e.g., font size, color, alignment).

2. Components:
   - Text Box: Editable text box that users can drag and drop onto the canvas.
   - Image: Image component that users can drag and drop onto the canvas and upload an image.
   - Button: Button component that users can drag and drop onto the canvas and edit the button text.

3. Editing and Styling:
   - Allow users to edit the content of the text boxes directly on the canvas.
   - Basic styling options (e.g., bold, italic, font size) for text components.
   - Option to change the background color of the canvas.

4. Preview:
   - A button to toggle between the design mode and preview mode, allowing users to see the final layout of their web page.

Technical Requirements
- Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (preferably with a framework like React).
- Libraries: 
  - Drag and drop functionality (e.g., `react-dnd` for React).
  - WYSIWYG editor library for text editing (e.g., `draft-js` or `quill`).

Deliverables
1. Source Code: Full source code in a public or private repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Documentation: A README file explaining how to set up and run the project, including any necessary environment variables.

Timeline
- Duration: 1 day from the start of the assignment.
- Submission: Source code repository link.

Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Implementation of the required features.
- Code Quality: Code organization, readability, and best practices.
- User Experience: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
- Documentation: Clarity of the README file and inline comments.

Steps to Complete the Assignment
1. Set Up Project:
   - Initialize a new project with your preferred framework (e.g., React).
   - Set up the basic project structure and include necessary dependencies.

2. Implement Canvas and Toolbar:
   - Create a canvas area for designing the web page.
   - Implement a toolbar with draggable components (text, image, button).

3. Implement Components:
   - Add functionality for draggable text box, image, and button components.
   - Allow users to edit the text content directly on the canvas.
   - Implement basic styling options for text components.

4. Implement Preview Mode:
   - Add a button to toggle between design mode and preview mode.
   - Ensure the preview mode displays the final layout of the web page.

5. Testing and Debugging:
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Fix any bugs or issues.

6. Submission:
   - Push the code to the repository.
   - Submit the deliverables as specified.

Additional Information
- Focus on creating a functional prototype with a simple and intuitive interface.
- Handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages where necessary.

Good luck!
